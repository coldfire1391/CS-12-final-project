# CS-12-final-project
For my final project for CS 12 (Computer Programming II in University of the Philippines - Diliman) we were tasked to create a turn-based game using our professor's (Sir Carreon, Mario) game engine (Mario Window). This is my submission.

Compile  and Execute CS12MP3.java to play the game
I used assets from Pokemon, a product by Gamefreak, Nintendo, and The Pokemon Company.
